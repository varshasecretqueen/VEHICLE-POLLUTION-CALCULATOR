                                                   VEHICLE POLLUTION CALCULATOR
                                          
 * The goal was to develop a tool that could estimate the environmental impact of various vehicles based on their emissions and fuel consumption. 
The challenge was designing an accurate and user-friendly calculator that could handle different types of vehicles and fuel options.
 * My task was to design and implement the calculator, including developing algorithms to estimate vehicle emissions based on provided data.
Additionally, I was responsible for creating a user interface that was simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily input their vehicle
details and receive pollution estimates.
 * I started by researching different methods for calculating vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency. Based on my research, I developed
algorithms that would take user input (such as vehicle type, model, and fuel consumption) and calculate the estimated pollution output.
 * The vehicle pollution calculator I developed provided accurate estimates for different types of vehicles.
